# BrainProxy2 v0.1.78 - Streaming Response Fix

## 🐛 Bug Fix

Fixed critical issue where streaming responses would hang after tool execution when tools returned results.

## Problem
When tools returned a string result, the streaming response would hang at "Making follow-up call after tool execution" and never complete the response to the user.

## Root Cause
The follow-up streaming logic after tool execution was too simplified and missing several critical features:
1. No error handling for the follow-up LLM call
2. No handling of empty responses or edge cases
3. Missing support for recursive tool calling (when the follow-up response contains more tool calls)
4. No proper handling of different finish reasons

## Solution
Completely rewrote the follow-up streaming logic to:

### 1. **Robust Error Handling**
- Try-catch blocks around the follow-up LLM call
- Error messages streamed to client if something fails
- Graceful fallback on exceptions

### 2. **Complete Streaming Support**
- Properly handle all finish reasons (`stop`, `length`, `tool_calls`)
- Stream empty responses when no content is generated
- Track whether content was actually streamed

### 3. **Recursive Tool Calling**
- Support for additional tool calls in the follow-up response
- Loop with max iterations (10) to prevent infinite recursion
- Execute additional tools and continue streaming

### 4. **Better Debugging**
- Added iteration counter in debug logs
- Track content streaming status
- Log additional tool call detection

## Changes Made

### `_handle_streaming` method:
- Replaced simple streaming loop with complete implementation
- Added recursive tool calling support with max 10 iterations
- Added proper error handling throughout
- Handle edge cases like empty responses
- Support for additional tool calls in follow-up responses

## Testing
```python
# Your application should now work correctly with:
# 1. Tools that return string results
# 2. Tools that return empty results
# 3. Chains of tool calls (tool -> response -> another tool)
# 4. Error cases during tool execution
```

## Version
- **Previous**: 0.1.77
- **Current**: 0.1.78
- **PyPI**: https://pypi.org/project/brain-proxy/0.1.78/

## Upgrade
```bash
pip install --upgrade brain-proxy==0.1.78
```

## Debug Output
With debug enabled, you'll now see:
- "Making follow-up call after tool execution for tenant {tenant} (iteration {n})"
- "Additional tool calls detected in follow-up"
- "Executing {n} additional tool calls"
- "Error in follow-up call: {error}" (if errors occur)
- "Error streaming follow-up response: {error}" (if streaming fails)

## Note
This fix ensures that tool execution results are properly streamed back to the user, regardless of whether the tool returns a value or not, and supports complex chains of tool calls.
