## üêõ Fix for Truncated Responses After Tool Execution

### The Problem
After tool execution, responses were being truncated - only showing the first 20-40 characters instead of the complete response. For example, seeing only "Ahora mismo, el clima en Santiago," instead of the full weather report.

### Root Cause
The response was being artificially chunked into 20-character pieces with delays between each chunk:
- `asyncio.sleep(0.005)` between chunks was causing issues
- The small chunk size and multiple delays were confusing the SSE client
- The client was interpreting the delays as stream completion

### The Solution
Since we already have the **complete response** from the non-streaming LLM call, we now send it all at once instead of artificially chunking it:

**Before (problematic):**
```python
# Artificially chunk and delay
for i in range(0, len(response_content), 20):
    chunk_text = response_content[i:i + 20]
    yield chunk
    await asyncio.sleep(0.005)  # This was causing issues!
```

**After (fixed):**
```python
# Send complete response in one chunk
response_chunk = {
    "choices": [{
        "index": 0,
        "delta": {"content": response_content},  # Full response
        "finish_reason": None
    }],
    # ...
}
yield f"data: {json.dumps(response_chunk)}\n\n"
```

### Why This Works
1. **No artificial delays**: The response is sent immediately
2. **Complete content**: No risk of truncation from chunking issues
3. **Simpler flow**: Less chance for timing-related bugs
4. **Better reliability**: The client receives the full response in one go

## üöÄ Deployment
```bash
pip install --upgrade brain-proxy==0.1.86
```

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior
With v0.1.86, after tool execution:
- The **complete response** will be displayed immediately
- No truncation or missing text
- No artificial streaming delays

The response is sent as a single SSE chunk, ensuring the client receives and displays the full content.
