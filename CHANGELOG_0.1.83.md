# Changelog for v0.1.83

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed Streaming Response Not Displaying After Tool Execution

**Problem:** When tools were executed in streaming mode, the server successfully:
- Executed the tool
- Generated a follow-up response 
- Attempted to stream it back

But the client never displayed the response, appearing to "hang" after tool execution.

**Root Cause:** The SSE (Server-Sent Events) stream was being interrupted when transitioning from tool detection to response streaming, causing the client to not receive/display the follow-up chunks.

## 🔧 Solutions Implemented

### 1. Stream Continuity
- Added a status chunk before breaking from initial stream when tool calls are detected
- Ensures the SSE connection remains active during tool execution

### 2. Improved Streaming Headers
```python
headers={
    "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
    "X-Accel-Buffering": "no",  # Disable Nginx buffering
    "Connection": "keep-alive"
}
```
- Prevents proxy/server buffering that could delay chunks

### 3. Force Flushing
- After each chunk, yield an empty string to trigger FastAPI's flush mechanism
- Ensures chunks are immediately sent to the client

### 4. Better Chunk Management
- Send initial empty chunk to establish stream continuity
- Increased chunk size from 10 to 20 characters for efficiency
- Reduced inter-chunk delay from 0.01s to 0.005s

### 5. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging throughout the streaming process
- Tracks chunk progress: "Streaming chunk X/Y"
- Logs full response content for debugging

## 📊 Testing

Test with tools that return data:
```python
# Your client should now properly display responses after tool execution
# Example: "The weather in Santiago is 11.4°C..."
```

## 🚀 Deployment

```bash
pip install --upgrade brain-proxy==0.1.83
```

## 🔍 Debug Output

With v0.1.83, you'll see:
- `"Starting to stream response of X characters"`
- `"Full response content: [preview]..."`
- `"Streaming chunk X/Y: 'text'"`
- `"Finished streaming X chunks"`
- `"Sending final chunk with finish_reason=stop"`
- `"Sending [DONE] marker"`

This ensures the full response is being generated and streamed correctly.
