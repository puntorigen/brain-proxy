# Changelog for v0.1.88

## üéØ Fix for OpenAI SSE Format Compliance

### The Problem
In v0.1.87, responses were not displaying at all after tool execution. The server was sending the response, but the client wasn't showing it.

### Root Cause
The SSE streaming format was not compliant with the OpenAI standard. We were sending content and `finish_reason: "stop"` in the same chunk, which violates the expected format.

### The OpenAI SSE Standard
The correct format requires:
1. **Content chunks**: Must have `finish_reason: null` (or `None`)
2. **Final chunk**: Must have empty delta and `finish_reason: "stop"`

### The Solution
We now send the response in the proper two-chunk format:

**Before (v0.1.87 - incorrect):**
```javascript
// Single chunk with both content and finish_reason
{ 
  delta: { content: "response text" }, 
  finish_reason: "stop"  // ‚ùå Should not be with content
}
```

**After (v0.1.88 - correct):**
```javascript
// Chunk 1: Content with null finish_reason
{ 
  delta: { content: "response text" }, 
  finish_reason: null  // ‚úÖ Correct for content
}

// Chunk 2: Empty delta with stop
{ 
  delta: {}, 
  finish_reason: "stop"  // ‚úÖ Signals completion
}
```

### Why This Works
- **Standard Compliance**: Follows the exact OpenAI SSE format
- **Client Compatibility**: OpenAI-compatible clients expect this specific pattern
- **Proper Separation**: Content and completion signals are properly separated

## üöÄ Deployment
```bash
pip install --upgrade brain-proxy==0.1.88
```

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior
With v0.1.88, after tool execution:
- The complete response will be displayed correctly
- No missing or silent responses
- Proper OpenAI SSE format ensures maximum client compatibility

## üìä Testing
You should see in logs:
```
[stream-id] Sending content chunk with finish_reason=null
[stream-id] Sending final chunk with finish_reason=stop
[stream-id] Response sent successfully
```

The response should now display correctly in all OpenAI-compatible clients!
