# BrainProxy2 v0.1.77 - Tool Execution Fix

## üêõ Bug Fix

Fixed critical issue where tools set via the `/tools` endpoint weren't being executed in the streaming path.

## Problem
The logs showed that BrainProxy2 was detecting and filtering tools correctly ("Using 1 of 10 tools", "Using 2 of 10 tools"), but the tools weren't actually being executed during streaming responses.

## Root Cause
The tool execution logic in the streaming path was only treating tools from the request (`request.tools`) as "local" tools that should be handled by `local_tools_handler`. However, tenant tools (set via the `/tools` endpoint) should ALSO be handled by the `local_tools_handler`.

## Solution
Updated both streaming and non-streaming paths to:
1. Collect all "local" tools from both sources:
   - Tools from the request (`request.tools`)
   - Tenant tools set via `/tools` endpoint (`self.tool_service._tenant_tools[tenant]`)
2. Any tool in this combined set is now correctly handled by `local_tools_handler`
3. Added debug logging to track tool execution flow

## Changes Made

### `_handle_streaming` method:
- Added collection of all local tools (request + tenant tools)
- Fixed tool execution logic to check against combined local tools set
- Added debug logging for tool execution tracing

### `_execute_tool_calls` method:
- Updated to use same logic as streaming path
- Consistent handling of local tools across both paths

### `ToolService.execute` method:
- Simplified to only handle registry tools
- Local tools are now handled before calling this method

## Testing
To test the fix:
```python
# Your application should now work correctly with:
# 1. Set tools via POST /v1/{tenant}/tools
# 2. Make streaming chat requests
# 3. Tools will be executed and results streamed back
```

## Version
- **Previous**: 0.1.76
- **Current**: 0.1.77
- **PyPI**: https://pypi.org/project/brain-proxy/0.1.77/

## Upgrade
```bash
pip install --upgrade brain-proxy==0.1.77
```

## Debug Logging
The fix includes additional debug logging to help trace tool execution:
- "Tool calls detected for tenant {tenant}: {count} calls"
- "Executing tool: {name} with args: {args}"
- "Calling local_tools_handler for: {name}"
- "Tool {name} result: {result}"

Enable debug mode in your config to see these logs:
```python
config = BrainProxyConfig(debug=True)
```
